Query the koji build target, if any, to find the enabled architectures. Remove any excluded
architectures, and return the resulting list.

build_orchestrate_build will prefer this list of architectures over the platforms supplied by
USER_PARAMS, which is necessary to allow autobuilds to build on the correct architectures
when koji build tags change.
